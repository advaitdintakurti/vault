Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science, enabling the creation of simplified interfaces that hide complex details. A well-designed **application program interface (API)** allows programmers to use functionality without understanding its internal workings. Programming languages like Java and C provide mechanisms for abstraction, such as class declarations and function prototypes.

#### Processor Abstractions
The **instruction set architecture (ISA)** abstracts the complexity of processor hardware, presenting a model where machine-code programs execute as if one instruction is processed at a time. In reality, modern hardware executes multiple instructions in parallel while maintaining the sequential execution model. This abstraction ensures compatibility across different processor implementations, accommodating various performance and cost levels.

#### Operating System Abstractions
1. **Files:** Abstract I/O devices, simplifying data storage and retrieval.
2. **Virtual Memory:** Abstracts physical memory, allowing programs to use more memory than physically available.
3. **Processes:** Abstract running programs, enabling multitasking.
4. **Virtual Machines:** Abstract entire computers, including hardware, operating systems, and applications. Originally introduced by IBM in the 1960s, virtual machines allow systems to run programs designed for different operating systems or versions, making them vital for modern computing environments.
