Modern systems are often linked to other systems by networks. 

**Networks** are a type of I/O device that can send and receive data. When a system copies bytes from its main memory to the network adapter, the data travels across the network to another machine.

Similarly, a system can read data that has been sent from other machines. Systems copy information from one machine to another via global networks such as the Internet.

We can use the telnet application to run `hello` on a remote machine. We use a telnet *client* running on our local machine to connect to a telnet *server* on a remote server.

> Telnet is a network protocol that allows users to access a remote computer and communicate with it in a text-based manner. It's short for "telecommunications network"
