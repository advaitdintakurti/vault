Sir,

I request a reconsideration of the hackathon team allocations. The current system, based on quiz and midsem scores, is unfair and negatively impacts both performance and learning.

- A hackathon is fast-paced, and teamwork matters more than our performance in past examinations (which are arguably not a good measure of how skilled we are.) Working with familiar teammates improves coordination and productivity, while the current allocation makes collaboration unnecessarily difficult for many people.
    
- If preferences weren’t going to be considered, why ask for them? Many of us carefully chose teammates based on compatibility and skills. Ignoring these choices only sets us up for a bad experience.
    
- In the real world, teams aren’t assigned by an algorithm that pairs people based on numbers. Managers carefully build teams based on skills, synergy, and experience, ensuring the best possible collaboration. The current system doesn’t reflect this reality and instead forces mismatched teams to struggle through an important graded component.
    
- Teamwork is a skill in itself. Selecting teammates requires communication and planning, skills just as valuable as technical ability. Allowing students to form their own teams encourages them to take responsibility of their success.
    

Since there’s still time, I request that teams be reallocated, or at least adjusted so each student gets atleast one of their preferred teammates. This small change would make a big difference.

Looking forward to your consideration.
