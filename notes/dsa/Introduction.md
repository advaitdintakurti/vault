A data structure is a scheme for organizing data in the memory of a computer. Data structures are containers and each is optimized for certain types of operations.

General data structure types include the array, the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on. Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.
